# Crack the Gate challenge 
**Platform:** picoCtf 
**category:** Web exploitation 

## description
We’re in the middle of an investigation. One of our persons of interest, ctf player, is believed to be hiding sensitive data inside a restricted 
web portal. We’ve uncovered the email address he uses to log in: ctf-player@picoctf.org. Unfortunately, we don’t know the password, and the usual
guessing techniques haven’t worked. But something feels off... it’s almost like the developer left a secret way in. Can you figure it out?

## objective 
Gain unauthorized access to a restircted web portal using a known email aderess 

## initial Analysis
The challenge presents a web based login portal associated with a restricted system. A valid email address is known, but standard passsword
guessing techniques are ineffective, suggesting a flaw in authentiucation logic rather than credntial strength
