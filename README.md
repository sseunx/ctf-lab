# CTF Lab & Security Projects

This repository documents my hands-on work solving Capture The Flag (CTF)
challenges and building small security tools to support analysis and investigation.

The focus is on methodology, tooling, and clear technical documentation rather than
publishing flags or spoilers.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Web security & authentication analysis
- Forensics & log analysis
- Blue team investigation techniques
- Python scripting for security automation
- Technical documentation

## Platforms
- picoCTF
- TryHackMe
- Hack The Box

## Structure

## Disclaimer
Writeups avoid publishing sensitive solutions or flags and are intended for educational and professional demonstration purposes.

## Featured Project: Authentication Bypass via Debug Header

This project demonstrates identification and exploitation of a client-side trust flaw
where a hidden debug HTTP header granted unauthorized access to protected resources.
The focus is on vulnerability analysis, not brute-force techniques.
